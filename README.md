# Computer-Graphics-Course-Homework
This course is an introduction to the rendering of the 3D computer graphics images. The main topics that covered were rendering algorithms, a software implementation of a basic 3D graphics pipeline, geometric modeling, model & view transformations, projections, lighting, shading and modern GPU hardware. Five times of Homework already attached to this repository, including the creation of "FrameBuffer" Object, defining "Model" data structures that can be used to build scenes and usinng models to to build a sequence of "Scene" data structures that can be given to the renderer to form a movie, implementing dynamic geometic shapes and dragging them around the window with different event listeners and manipulation of models in the scene.
