/**
   This class is an interface between our renderer and the Java GUI system.
<p>
   This class is meant to be instantiated as a sub-panel of a
   {@link javax.swing.JFrame}. The {@link javax.swing.JFrame} may or may
   not implement event listeners. If the {@link javax.swing.JFrame} does
   implement event listeners, then the event listeners can make our
   renderer interactive.
<p>
   Each instance of {@code FrameBufferPanel} has a reference to a
   {@link FrameBuffer} object and the {@link FrameBuffer} object
   determines the (preferred) dimensions of this {@link JPanel}.
<p>
   When a GUI event happens, any implemented event listener would update
   this {@link JPanel} by modifying a {@link renderer.scene.Scene} object
   appropriately and then having our renderer render the
   {@link renderer.scene.Scene} object into the {@link FrameBuffer}.
   When the renderer is done updating the {@link FrameBuffer}, the
   event listener will call this object's {@link #update} method, which will
   pass the {@link FrameBuffer}'s pixel data to the {@link java.awt.Image}
   being drawn on the {@link java.awt.Graphics} context of the
   {@link FrameBufferPanel} (which is a {@link JPanel}). Then the event
   listener will call the {@link javax.swing.JFrame}'s repaint() method
   which will trigger this object's {@link #paintComponent} method. This
   will display the {@link java.awt.Image} (that holds the
   {@link FrameBuffer}'s contents) in the {@link JPanel} within this
   {@link javax.swing.JFrame}'s window.
<p>
   This panel may be resizeable. When this panel resizes, its
   {@link FrameBuffer} object will also need to resize. But
   {@link FrameBuffer} objects cannot be resized. So each time this
   panel resizes, the resize event handler should instantiate a new
   {@link FrameBuffer} object with the appropriate dimensions and
   then call this object's setFrameBuffer() method with a reference
   to the new {@link FrameBuffer} object.
